Hey peeps.

Basically my approach was generate all the averages I could think of.
Pick the most sensible one and do a local optimisation using that as an initial value.

The averages I calculated were:
mean
root mean square
mean root square (cos we love being silly)
Geometric Mean

I had some additional fun in that geometric means don't deal with zero very well.
So I tried 3 different methods of handling this.
1) Add one to all values, calculate the GM, minus one from the GM
2) Just ignore zeros yay
3) Just pretend all zeros are one
I then calcualted the mean of the geometric means (here on MoGMs)

I have tried both part A and B with each initial conditions for lols. Here are the times and number of optimisation loops needed.

Part A:

mean		152 loops		1.72s
RMS			324 loops		1.76s
MRS			325 loops		1.78s
MoGMs		85 loops		1.76s

Part B:
mean		1 loop			1.77s
RMS			173 loops		5.38s
MRS			476 loops		11.07s
MoGMs		236 loops		6.11s
